/**
 * Author: Sridhar Duraisamy
 * Class which implement Game Of Life Simulation
 *
 * Definition
 * The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of
 * which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which
 * are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
 *
 * Rules
 * At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
 * 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by underpopulation.
 * 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
 * 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.
 * 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
 * The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the
 * above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the
 * discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a
 * pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further
 * generations.
